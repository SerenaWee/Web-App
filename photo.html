              The Boeing 707 was the first successful commercial jetliner and
              marked the beginning of the Jet Age in the 1950s. It was developed
              from Boeing's 367-80 prototype and made its first flight in 1957.
              The 707 entered commercial service with Pan Am in 1958,
              drastically reducing flight times and making international air
              travel more accessible. It featured a sleek design, swept wings,
              and four jet engines, carrying up to 189 passengers at high
              speeds. Several variants were produced, including longer-range and
              cargo versions. The aircraft also served in military roles, such
              as the KC-135 tanker and E-3 AWACS. Over 1,000 Boeing 707s were
              built before production ended in 1979. Its success cemented
              Boeing's dominance in commercial aviation and influenced
              generations of aircraft to come.

              The Boeing 717 is a twin-engine, short-haul commercial jet
              originally designed by McDonnell Douglas as the MD-95. After
              Boeing merged with McDonnell Douglas in 1997, the aircraft was
              renamed the Boeing 717. It made its first flight in 1998 and
              entered service in 1999 with AirTran Airways. The 717 was built to
              serve regional routes, typically carrying between 100 and 117
              passengers. It featured modern avionics, efficient engines, and
              was known for its reliability and low operating costs. Despite its
              performance, the aircraft struggled in a competitive market with
              rising demand for larger regional jets. Production ended in 2006
              after only 156 aircraft were built. Today, the 717 remains in
              service with a few airlines, most notably Delta Air Lines and
              Hawaiian Airlines.

              The Boeing 727 is a three-engine, narrow-body jet airliner
              designed for short to medium-haul routes. It first flew in 1963
              and entered commercial service in 1964 with Eastern Air Lines. The
              727 was built to operate from shorter runways and smaller
              airports, making it ideal for domestic flights. Its unique T-tail
              and rear-mounted engines gave it a distinctive look and quieter
              cabin. The aircraft could carry around 130 to 180 passengers,
              depending on the model. It became one of the most popular jets of
              its time, with over 1,800 built. The 727 was widely used by
              airlines around the world throughout the 1960s, 70s, and 80s.
              Though mostly retired from passenger service, some 727s still fly
              today in cargo and private roles.

              The Boeing 737 is a twin-engine, narrow-body jet introduced in
              1968 as a short-haul aircraft. It quickly became popular due to
              its low operating costs and ability to operate from smaller
              airports. Over the decades, it has evolved through multiple
              generations, including the Classic, Next Generation (NG), and the
              737 MAX. It typically seats between 85 and 215 passengers
              depending on the variant. The 737 is the best-selling commercial
              jet in history, with more than 10,000 built. Its reliability,
              efficiency, and global support network have made it a favorite
              among airlines worldwide. Despite temporary grounding of the 737
              MAX, the aircraft continues to dominate the short- to medium-haul
              market. It remains a key part of Boeing’s commercial fleet.

              The Boeing 747, nicknamed the “Jumbo Jet,” was the world’s first
              wide-body airliner and entered service in 1970. It was designed to
              carry large numbers of passengers on long-haul routes and featured
              an iconic humpbacked upper deck. With seating for over 400
              passengers, it revolutionized global travel by making
              international flights more accessible. The 747 was initially
              intended to serve as both a passenger and cargo aircraft. It
              became a symbol of luxury and power in aviation for decades.
              Boeing produced multiple variants, including the 747-400 and
              747-8. More than 1,500 were built before passenger production
              ended in 2023. Although largely retired from passenger service,
              the 747 continues to serve as a freighter and in specialized
              roles.

              The Boeing 757 is a narrow-body, mid-size jet introduced in 1983
              for medium- to long-range routes. It was designed to replace the
              Boeing 727 and featured improved fuel efficiency and performance.
              The aircraft is known for its powerful engines and ability to
              operate from short runways or at high altitudes. It typically
              seats 200 to 243 passengers and has strong transcontinental range.
              Airlines appreciated its flexibility for both domestic and
              transatlantic routes. Despite its popularity, production ended in
              2004 after 1,050 were built. Many 757s remain in service today,
              especially with Delta and cargo carriers like FedEx. The 757 is
              often praised by pilots for its handling and performance.

              shares cockpit and systems similarities with it. The 767 was
              Boeing’s first twin-engine jet approved for long overwater flights
              under ETOPS regulations. It typically seats between 181 and 375
              passengers, depending on the model and configuration. The aircraft
              is used for both passenger and cargo transport, with the 767F
              freighter still in production. Airlines have used the 767 for
              long-haul flights due to its reliability and range. Over 1,200

              fully designed using computer-aided design (CAD). The 777 is known
              for its spacious cabin, long range, and high fuel efficiency. It
              typically seats between 314 and 396 passengers, making it ideal
              for international travel. Multiple variants exist, including the
              extended-range 777-200ER and the 777-300ER. The aircraft is
              favored by major international airlines for transcontinental and
              transoceanic routes. Over 1,700 units have been delivered, with
              the next-generation 777X currently in development. It remains one

              quality, larger windows, and quieter engines for a better
              passenger experience. It comes in three versions: 787-8, 787-9,
              and 787-10, seating between 242 and 330 passengers. The aircraft
              is capable of flying ultra-long-haul routes while using less fuel.
              Its efficiency has opened up more direct international routes for
              airlines. The Dreamliner has become a favorite for both passengers
