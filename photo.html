              The Boeing 707 was the first successful commercial jetliner and
              marked the beginning of the Jet Age in the 1950s. It was developed
              from Boeing's 367-80 prototype and made its first flight in 1957.
              The 707 entered commercial service with Pan Am in 1958,
              drastically reducing flight times and making international air
              travel more accessible. It featured a sleek design, swept wings,
              and four jet engines, carrying up to 189 passengers at high
              speeds. Several variants were produced, including longer-range and
              cargo versions. The aircraft also served in military roles, such
              as the KC-135 tanker and E-3 AWACS. Over 1,000 Boeing 707s were
              built before production ended in 1979. Its success cemented
              Boeing's dominance in commercial aviation and influenced
              generations of aircraft to come.

              The Boeing 717 is a twin-engine, short-haul commercial jet
              originally designed by McDonnell Douglas as the MD-95. After
              Boeing merged with McDonnell Douglas in 1997, the aircraft was
              renamed the Boeing 717. It made its first flight in 1998 and
              entered service in 1999 with AirTran Airways. The 717 was built to
              serve regional routes, typically carrying between 100 and 117
              passengers. It featured modern avionics, efficient engines, and
              was known for its reliability and low operating costs. Despite its
              performance, the aircraft struggled in a competitive market with
              rising demand for larger regional jets. Production ended in 2006
              after only 156 aircraft were built. Today, the 717 remains in
              service with a few airlines, most notably Delta Air Lines and
              Hawaiian Airlines.

              The Boeing 727 is a three-engine, narrow-body jet airliner
              designed for short to medium-haul routes. It first flew in 1963
              and entered commercial service in 1964 with Eastern Air Lines. The
              727 was built to operate from shorter runways and smaller
              airports, making it ideal for domestic flights. Its unique T-tail
              and rear-mounted engines gave it a distinctive look and quieter
              cabin. The aircraft could carry around 130 to 180 passengers,
              depending on the model. It became one of the most popular jets of
              its time, with over 1,800 built. The 727 was widely used by
              airlines around the world throughout the 1960s, 70s, and 80s.
              Though mostly retired from passenger service, some 727s still fly
              today in cargo and private roles.

              The A330 is a twin-engine, wide-body aircraft used for medium to
              long-haul flights, seating 250 to 300 passengers. With a range of
              around 6,700 nautical miles (12,400 km), it’s ideal for

              The A340 is a four-engine, wide-body airliner designed for
              long-haul routes, seating 261 to 475 passengers. It has a range of
              up to 9,000 nautical miles (16,700 km), making it suitable for
              ultra-long flights. While popular in its time, the A340 has been
              largely replaced by more fuel-efficient twin-engine models like
              the A350. Airlines such as Lufthansa and Air France used it for
              high-capacity, long-distance routes, but it’s becoming less common
              due to its higher fuel consumption. The A340 is still in service
              with a few carriers, but its four-engine design is no longer
              competitive. Despite this, it remains an iconic aircraft known for
              its large capacity and range. It was a key part of aviation
              history in the 1990s and early 2000s. The A340’s large size and
              range made it ideal for high-demand international routes.

              The A350 is a twin-engine, wide-body aircraft designed for
              long-haul routes, with a seating capacity of 300 to 410
              passengers. It offers a range of about 8,000 nautical miles
              (14,800 km), making it ideal for long-distance international
              flights. The A350 features advanced materials for improved fuel
              efficiency and lower emissions. Airlines like Qatar Airways and
              Singapore Airlines use the A350 for ultra-long flights, competing
              directly with the Boeing 787. The aircraft’s quieter engines and
              modern cabin design enhance passenger comfort, making it popular
              on long flights. It has a high operational efficiency and offers
              reduced maintenance costs compared to older aircraft. The
              A350-1000 is the larger variant, with more capacity and extended

            <p>
              The A380 is the world’s largest passenger aircraft, designed for
              high-capacity, long-haul flights. It seats up to 850 passengers in
              an all-economy configuration, with 555 seats in a three-class
              layout. The A380 has a range of around 8,000 nautical miles
              (14,800 km), perfect for major international routes. Its two
              full-length passenger decks provide unmatched space and comfort
              for passengers. While it’s a giant, its high fuel consumption and
              competition from more efficient twin-engine aircraft have led to
              fewer orders in recent years. Airlines like Emirates and Singapore
              Airlines operate the A380 on the busiest routes, using it to
              maximize capacity. Despite its size, the A380 offers a relatively
              quiet and smooth ride. It remains a symbol of luxury and capacity
              but is gradually being phased out in favor of smaller, more
              efficient aircraft.
